Description: The .gif files represent two animations: y-z_projection_500meter_ISSR  and  2) y-z_projection_500meter_ISSR_20percent_rand. Both simulations use the same initial conditions: Temperature: T = 212 K ISSR thickness: 500 m (100 m above and 400 m below the reference altitude) Constant supersaturation: sᵢ = 0.2 (20%) followed by a subsaturated layer with entrainment; and Synthetic initial geometry and particle radius. The only difference between the two cases is that the rand version includes 20% white Gaussian noise added to the sᵢ equation at each iteration, whereas the other simulation does not include stochastic perturbations.
